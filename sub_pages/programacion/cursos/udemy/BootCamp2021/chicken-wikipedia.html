                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[22][23][24] and is widely used throughout North America. "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which is done by both sexes.
